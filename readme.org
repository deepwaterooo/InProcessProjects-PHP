*** MySQL database 
- Launch MySQL from terminal: 

  #+BEGIN_SRC php
mysql -u root -p
  #+END_SRC

followed by entering password created for the 'root' user. 
- Create a mysql database

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
CREATE DATABASE practice;
#+END_SRC

- Create a mysql user

For creating a new user with all privileges (use only for troubleshooting), at mysql prompt type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'yourusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword' WITH GRANT OPTION;
#+END_SRC

- select database
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
use practice;
#+END_SRC

- create table for username/password

* PHP routing
- tried to follow the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reEBParHzQ, but failed to make it work out within today's a few hours. 

* Summary
- I had been mislead by course instructor's project deadline on "Course Work" which has listed to be 1/10/2016 11:55pm. 

  [[./pic/deadline.png]]

- I noticed the course instructor changed the deadline for project due time through the 12/30/2015 announcement last night (this morning) around 1:00am. 
- When I download the final exam questionnaire form the website as study guide on 12/31/2015, I checked the "Coursework" project deadline is still 1/10/2016, so I have NOT check the website ever since that day.
- I checked the website middle night in the early morning trying to see if there is any new material for the final exam, then noticed the announcement on 12/30/2015. 
- I am currently seeking place to move in, and got especially tired recent days (yesterday has staff on hands from 7:30am - today 1:30am)
- When I learn this news, I am confident and believe I could finish my project successfully on time as the original due time, and that's reason when I have time and energy, I try to focus on something I am interested, rather than stick to some not so interested project. 
- But the confidence does NOT mean that I could successfully finish a project within a few hours, especially when I have got tired the day before already. 
- So I tried reach to the course instructor and get some extension. I wrote to him at 1:07am, but I have NOT got any feedback from him yet.

subject:	PHP Team Project Deadline

mailed-by:	..xdkfl

Dear Professor, 

I just noticed that from your 12/30/2015 announcements that the team project is due on Monday 1/4/2016 5:00pm. i have not noticed this announcements until a few minutes ago, and I have taken it for granted that the team project is due on 1/10/2016, so I have not finished my individual project yet, and I don't think I could finish and turn in any good by the evening 5:00pm. 

I feel sorry that I have had too many other things that occupied too much of my study time for the Fall semester (thing could change better in Spring semester), and have been late for my PHP individual project. I hope you could understand, and I am writing trying to ask if it is still OK for me to turn in my "Team Project" (actually my individual project) by the original deadline 1/10/2016 11:55pm. 

Now I feel anxious and look forward to hearing back from you. And thanks a lot for any potential extension. 

me
 
- I worked a few hours to get signup/login to some extent into shape, and then changed the topic to build PHP routing. 
- The linux LAMP for MySQL is pretty easy, but trying to understand and code the routing part took me quite some hours (due to headache), and has NOT solve this problem yet, but as usual, this does NOT affect my confidence at all. I believe in myself that with reasonable amount of time, I could solve the problem I am into. 
- Instead of any FAILURE, this experience rather warns me to pay attention to course instructor's deadline more carefully then beat/destroy any of my confidence.  
- I don't have any window's system, and the classmates know about this. I will try to reach the course instructor when I have chance to talk to him. 

* Requirements
- Use the  sample html and css file provided in the course resources folder to build a home page for your website. 
- You can customize the page by modifying html and css files. Use your own colors and images. 
- You will be creating a minimum of 4 pages or more website. 
- The subsequent pages should have the same header, left navigation and footer, but the body may contain different. 
- Provide a sign in /signup option in the landing page. 
- On page to add html forms and process the form data using php on the server. 
- Use javascript, angJavscript and PHP code where ever needed
